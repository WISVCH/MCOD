                    <h2>Career Orientation Days - 28/04/2021 & 29/04/2021</h2>
                    <p>The event previously known as the Mathematical Career Orientation Day has been expanded! This year, there will also be a separate day for Computer Science students. Donâ€™t worry, the event as you might already know it will remain completely untouched. On the 28th of April, the day for Applied Mathematics students will take place and the 29th of April will be the day for Computer Science students.</p>
                    <p>The Career Orientation Days are aimed at students who are currently studying Applied Mathematics or Computer Science & Engineering and are eager to find out what they can do after finishing their studies. During the event, you will get the opportunity to have one-on-one talks with graduates of your study who are currently working at the participating companies. This can be just an orientating conversation, but the interview may also directly lead to a job, internship or graduation project!</p>
                    <p>Throughout the day, there will also be talks about pursuing a career in education or academia. The day will end with a keynote speech by an alumnus of Applied Mathematics. It is also possible to sign up for these talks in the registration form, which will be available later.</p>
